# Websockets debug project: MSN 2020
In a pair, we created an MSN-like IM application through debugging base code using various debugging tools.
We completed this project in week 12 of the School of Code bootcamp. 
The purpose of the task was to get hands on with websockets within React and to use the developer debugging tools.
After debugging the project and getting it functional, I modified the app and the CSS to be reminiscent of MSN.
